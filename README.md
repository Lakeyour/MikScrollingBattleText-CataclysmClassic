# MikScrollingBattleText-CataclysmClassic
MikScrollingBattleText Cataclysm Classic for 4.4.0

## Disclaimer: I am not the original author of this addon, this being one of my favorite addons, I would hate to see it in a state that does not work, so I had to fix it.
## Credits to ErikTMA for 5.9.1 fixes, he is likely the original author, but I could not be sure, as well as the Curseforge maintainer.

### Installation
Extract the zip into MikScrollingBattleText-CataclysmClassic-main
You will have MikScrollingBattleText and MSBTOptions in this folder, these are the files you will put into the C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns folder, you can safely ignore README.md.
## Do not put in the whole folder of MikScrollingBattleText-CataclysmClassic-main, since this will not work.
